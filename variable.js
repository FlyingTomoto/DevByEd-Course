// JavaScript variable information :)  

let inbox = 100; // let is to declare a variable, variable is inbox, and equals is to assign that variable something
inbox = 50; // even though above, inbox equals 100, by saying it equals 50 now it will be changed to 50
alert(inbox); // this will create a alert popup on the page with the last value stated

//

let inbox1 = 100;
let inbox2 = 250;
let allEmails = inbox1 + inbox2; // this will result allEmails equaling 350
alert(allEmails); // an alert will pop up with the value of inbox1 and inbox2

//

const inbox = 100 // const is another way of creating a variable, although it bust be assigned a value, unlike let
// also with const, you cannot change the value like you can with let

//camelCase - in javaScript, your variable has to be one word, so it is best to have alternating lower and upper case for the words
let yourVideos = 20;
